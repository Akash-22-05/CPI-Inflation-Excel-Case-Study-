# CPI Inflation Dashboard (India) ðŸ“Š

This project presents a **CPI (Consumer Price Index) Inflation Analysis Dashboard** created using Excel. The dashboard provides insights into various CPI components, their contributions, trends over time, and correlation with crude oil prices. It highlights inflation dynamics in rural and urban areas and tracks changes pre- and post-COVID-19.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

To analyze the trends in India's CPI inflation between 2018 and 2023 and derive key insights into how different categories (like food, fuel, health, etc.) have contributed to the overall inflation. The goal is to understand inflationary patterns, seasonality, and external correlations (like crude oil prices).
